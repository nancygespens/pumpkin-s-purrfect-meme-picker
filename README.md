## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Data: [catsData](data.js)

## How It Works

### HTML
The structure includes:
- A header with the app title and a small image (pumpkin).
- A main section with:
  - Emotion selection (radio buttons).
  - Option to filter only GIFs.
  - Button to get a meme image.
  - A modal to display the chosen meme image.

### CSS
The styles ensure that the app is both functional and visually appealing, with elements like the modal implemented using Flexbox for proper alignment.

### JavaScript
- **Emotion selection:** Users can pick an emotion, and the app will filter the available cat memes based on that emotion. 
- **GIF toggle:** You can filter the results to show only GIFs by ticking the checkbox.
- **Modal window:** After selecting an emotion and getting an image, the meme will appear inside a modal that can be closed.
  
The app pulls data from the `catsData` array defined in the `data.js` file.
